# Port of Learn Opengl to Rust

This code is mostly for me to do the learnopengl.com lessons and port them to rust for my own use. Be advised stuff might not work or be wrong.

For a more complete Rust version see this repo https://github.com/srcres258/learnopengl-rust as it is recommended by LearnOpenGL.com

As I am pretty much porting the C++ code to Rust. The license is the same as the C++ code:
